**This is a new open letter for the consignment of the Warehouse registered under the company name “Sea Beach Immobiliare S.r.l”, and located in Via Natale Carta no. 1 - 3 (ex Via BC 20), Palermo, Italy.**

Dear Sirs,

We are a group of students from the Liceo delle Scienze Umane e
Linguistico "Danilo Dolci", located in Via Fichidindia, in the area of
Brancaccio, Palermo.

Within the frame of the workshop on **Open Data and Civic Monitoring**,
run by Andrea Borruso ([*Confiscati
Bene*](http://www.confiscatibene.it/it)) and coordinated by our teacher
Prof. Ferdinando Siringo (Liceo “Danilo Dolci”, March 15th-20th 2018),
as part of the preliminary events that accompany and precede
“Confiscated Properties: Architecture, Ideology, and Performance”**,** a
project curated by Valentina Sansone (June 16th-November 4th 2018), we
worked on a journalistic investigation which has brought to our
attention that:

 • Italian Law no. 109 from March 7th 1996 (Rognoni La Torre) provides
 for the granting to third parties of all property confiscated due to
 the activities of organized crime. By converting them to socially
 beneficial uses, the third parties return the properties to the
 community.

 • According to up-to-date[ data released by
 ](https://openregio.it/)[*OpenRegio*](https://openregio.it/), the city
 of Palermo includes 1836 properties and 145 companies confiscated from
 mafia and assigned to the Municipality.

Among those confiscated properties, a large warehouse, in our school’s
immediate surroundings has moved us to action: it is located in Via
Natale Carta 1 - 3 (ex Via BC 20, Palermo), registered under the company
name “SEA BEACH IMMOBILIARE SRL”.

Since 2000, “Danilo Dolci” high school is located in a confiscated
property in the Brancaccio area, Palermo. An example of **legality**,
our school is located in a neighborhood with a high percentage of
criminality, which is also affected by the problem of early school
leaving.

With this letter, we want to access the confiscated warehouse in order
to **transform** **it into a gym and a place for cultural and creative
activities**. In the morning, the space can be open to the students, who
currently do not have a space for physical education. During the rest of
the day, the warehouse can be open to all, and offer a new facility for
the entire neighborhood.

Our investigation also aims to return the confiscated property to its
citizens **after almost twenty years**. Once open to its community and
to the students, the depot can become a theatre, a café and a library, a
gym or a place where it is possible to gather and discuss, to share
thoughts and ideas.

Palermo, the **Italian Capital of Culture in 2018**, from June 16th,
will also host Manifesta 12, the International Biennale of Contemporary
Art, one of the most important cultural events in the international
scenario.

As part of the selected events that form Manifesta 12 “Collateral
Events” program, we suggest that the warehouse in Brancaccio host the
community-based project “[*Confiscated Properties: Architecture,
Ideology, and
Performance*](http://m12.manifesta.org/gli-eventi-collaterali-di-manifesta-12/?lang=it)”
by The Great Learning Orchestra, curated by Valentina Sansone. We
believe that our collaboration in this event will also give us and our
school great visibility.

**Back in 2015**, another group of students from our Institute, led by
Prof. Luigi Barbieri, compiled and released a statement
([*http://bit.ly/2HVrFfM*](http://bit.ly/2HVrFfM)) and
a[*"videoletter"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mf1N_0YvbM&feature=youtu.be)
(“Prevent Illegality: To disarm mafia by the creation of social
innovation, awareness and work” in collaboration with “Progetto Legalità
ONLUS" Foundation) addressed to ANBSC and to Leoluca Orlando, Mayor of
Palermo, among others. As with today’s open letter, in 2015, the
students from this school wanted to access the warehouse in order to be
able to “create a gym and facilities for music, theatre and cultural
activities for the school and the local area”.

This first request was followed by the Mayor’s answer
([*http://bit.ly/2HTUmK6*](http://bit.ly/2HTUmK6)), **which
unfortunately has not produced any concrete result yet**: 

> “We immediately embraced the 
> equest of the students of the Institute Danilo Dolci. We are in
> contact with the Director ofANBSC the Prefect Umberto Postiglione,
> with the Province and with the Judicial Administration, owner of > the
> property, in order to facilitate the return of the warehouse to > the
> institute.”

We are confident that you will support our request, time is up for this
situation to change.

Thank you in advance for your collaboration, and we are looking forward
to hearing from you.
